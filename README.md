# python-microgrid

![Build](https://github.com/Total-RD/pymgrid/workflows/build/badge.svg?dummy=unused)

*python-microgrid* is a python library to generate and simulate a large number of microgrids. It is an extension of TotalEnergies' [*pymgrid*](https://github.com/Total-RD/pymgrid).

For more context, please see the [presentation](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/3) done at Climate Change AI
and the [documentation](https://python-microgrid.readthedocs.io/).

## Installation

The easiest way to install python-microgrid is with pip:

`pip install -U python-microgrid`

Alternatively, you can install from source. First clone the repo:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahalev/python-microgrid.git
``` 
Then navigate to the root directory of python-microgrid and call

```bash
pip install .
```
## Getting Started

Microgrids are straightforward to generate from scratch. Simply define some modules and pass them
to a microgrid:
```python
import numpy as np
from pymgrid import Microgrid
from pymgrid.modules import GensetModule, BatteryModule, LoadModule, RenewableModule


genset = GensetModule(running_min_production=10,
                      running_max_production=50,
                      genset_cost=0.5)

battery = BatteryModule(min_capacity=0,
                        max_capacity=100,
                        max_charge=50,
                        max_discharge=50,
                        efficiency=1.0,
                        init_soc=0.5)

# Using random data
renewable = RenewableModule(time_series=50*np.random.rand(100))

load = LoadModule(time_series=60*np.random.rand(100),
                  loss_load_cost=10)

microgrid = Microgrid([genset, battery, ("pv", renewable), load])
```

This creates a microgrid with the modules defined above, as well as an unbalanced energy module -- 
which reconciles situations when energy demand cannot be matched to supply.

Printing the microgrid gives us its architecture:

```python
>> microgrid

Microgrid([genset x 1, load x 1, battery x 1, pv x 1, balancing x 1])
```

A microgrid is contained of fixed modules and flex modules. Some modules can be both -- `GridModule`, for example
-- but not at the same time.


A *fixed* module has requires a request of a certain amount of energy ahead of time, and then attempts to 
produce or consume said amount. `LoadModule` is an example of this; you must tell it to consume a certain amount of energy
and it will then do so.

 A *flex* module, on the other hand, is able to adapt to meet demand. `RenewableModule` is an example of this as
 it allows for curtailment of any excess renewable produced.
 
 A microgrid will tell you which modules are which:
 
 ```python
>> microgrid.fixed_modules

{
  "genset": "[GensetModule(running_min_production=10, running_max_production=50, genset_cost=0.5, co2_per_unit=0, cost_per_unit_co2=0, start_up_time=0, wind_down_time=0, allow_abortion=True, init_start_up=True, raise_errors=False, provided_energy_name=genset_production)]",
  "load": "[LoadModule(time_series=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, loss_load_cost=10, forecaster=NoForecaster, forecast_horizon=0, forecaster_increase_uncertainty=False, raise_errors=False)]",
  "battery": "[BatteryModule(min_capacity=0, max_capacity=100, max_charge=50, max_discharge=50, efficiency=1.0, battery_cost_cycle=0.0, battery_transition_model=None, init_charge=None, init_soc=0.5, raise_errors=False)]"
}

>>microgrid.flex_modules

{
  "pv": "[RenewableModule(time_series=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, raise_errors=False, forecaster=NoForecaster, forecast_horizon=0, forecaster_increase_uncertainty=False, provided_energy_name=renewable_used)]",
  "balancing": "[UnbalancedEnergyModule(raise_errors=False, loss_load_cost=10, overgeneration_cost=2)]"
}

```


Running the microgrid is straightforward. Simply pass an action for each fixed module to `microgrid.run`. The microgrid
can also provide you a random action by calling `microgrid.sample_action.` Once the microgrid has been run for a
certain number of steps, results can be viewed by calling microgrid.get_log.

```python
>> for j in range(10):
>>    action = microgrid.sample_action(strict_bound=True)
>>    microgrid.run(action)

>> microgrid.get_log(drop_singleton_key=True)

      genset  ...                     balance
      reward  ... fixed_absorbed_by_microgrid
0  -5.000000  ...                   10.672095
1 -14.344353  ...                   50.626726
2  -5.000000  ...                   17.538018
3  -0.000000  ...                   15.492778
4  -0.000000  ...                   35.748724
5  -0.000000  ...                   30.302300
6  -5.000000  ...                   36.451662
7  -0.000000  ...                   66.533872
8  -0.000000  ...                   20.645077
9  -0.000000  ...                   10.632957
```

## Benchmarking

`pymgrid` also comes pre-packaged with a set of 25 microgrids for benchmarking.
The config files for these microgrids are available in `data/scenario/pymgrid25`.
Simply deserialize one of the yaml files to load one of the saved microgrids; for example,
to load the zeroth microgrid:

```python
import yaml
from pymgrid import PROJECT_PATH

yaml_file = PROJECT_PATH / 'data/scenario/pymgrid25/microgrid_0/microgrid_0.yaml'
microgrid = yaml.safe_load(yaml_file.open('r'))
```

Alternatively, `Microgrid.load(yaml_file.open('r'))` will perform the same deserialization.

## Data

Data in pymgrid are based on TMY3 (data based on representative weather). The PV data comes from DOE/NREL/ALLIANCE (https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/about/tmy.html) and the load data comes from OpenEI (https://openei.org/doe-opendata/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-states)

The CO2 data is from Jacque de Chalendar and his gridemissions API.
